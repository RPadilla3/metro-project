# **Metro Project**

## The Iron Yard Final Project (FEE 2016)

This is a web application designed to be used with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority API.
This is a user application to make commuting through the DC metro system much easier. This application will provide metro rail information include where the trains are in distance from your stop, this is a live train locator that is updated every 7sec. Also this app will show users if there are any delays on the metro including station names and reason for delays. There is form for the user to fill out with their desired to and from stations to get back all relative commute information including time in minutes distance in miles and pricing depending on the time.

*This application is written using Angular JS*

To work on this code after the repo is cloned you will need to run an `npm install` in your terminal in order to download all dependencies necessary to run the build of this web app.

The site is continuously deployed onto Heroku on every commit to the Master Branch.  


As for testing you will need to install the [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) framework and [chai](http://chaijs.com/) library onto your machine, and for automated task running this app is using [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), You will need to install some tasks to run onto your gruntfile in order to work on this project smoothly.
These tasks include:
* grunt-contrib-jshint
* grunt-contrib-clean
* grunt-contrib-concat
* grunt-contrib-copy
* grunt-contrib-concat
* grunt-contrib-watch
* grunt-contrib-sass
* grunt-karma

You are going to want to save those as dev-dependencies while installing so use
(example)

`npm install --save-dev grunt-contrib-jshint`
