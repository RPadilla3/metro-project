## The Iron Yard Final Project (FEE 2016)

This is a web application designed to be used with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Api.
This is a user application to make commuting through the DC metro system much easier. This application will provide metro rail information include where the trains are in distance from your stop and if there are any delays on that line. This application will also provide station information including the amount of parking spaces currently available and the price of parking per day. User has the ability to create an account and customize their route to show only what they wish to see. All alerts/delays will be posted including elevator/escalator alerts at all stations.

* This application is written using Angular JS. *

To work on this code after the repo is cloned you will need to run an `npm install` in your terminal in order to download all dependencies necessary to run the build of this web app.
